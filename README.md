# CamHALChanger
This app is for people like me who prefer the higher exposure time of the Stock HAL in low light (brighter and less noisy photos), but at the same time want to use all the features of Sultanxda's custom HAL like 4K video, etc.  
It can also be used if you want to compare the two HALs or decide to revert to Stock in the future (no need to dirty flash your ROM now!).  

Features:  
-Switch between Stock and Sultanxda's custom HAL on the fly (no reboot required!)   
-Backup and restore Stock HAL files (no need of a revert zip now)  
-Launch your default Camera from within the app  

Installation Instructions:  
1. Install the APK file    
2. Dirty flash your current ROM (only if you have already flashed Sultan's HAL)   
3. Press the Backup button in the app (Status should say "Not Installed" at this time)   
4. Flash Sultan's HAL zip from recovery

(Requires a rooted OnePlus X with Android 5.1.1 and above)
